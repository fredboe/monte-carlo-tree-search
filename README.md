# monte-carlo-tree-search

## Project:
This project will contain a basic implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Furthermore, you can find some other agents (AlphaBeta, Random) you can try out against MCTS.
In the future I will provide you with some diagrams that show the performance of MCTS.
There will also be some diagrams that show the difference between the selection-functions (UCB1 and others).
In addition, I want to explain why these functions perform well (reasons) and I want to explain how MCTS works (in moderate detail).
For those who find this algorithm interesting I will also add some further reading/information below.

## Code
I would be really pleased about some suggestions of improvement for my code or other stuff like documentation. (documentation will be added very soon)
