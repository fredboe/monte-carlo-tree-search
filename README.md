# monte-carlo-tree-search

**This is Version 1**

## Project
This project contains a basic implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Furthermore, you can find some other agents (AlphaBeta, Random) which you can try out against MCTS.

For those who find this algorithm interesting I will also add some further reading/information below.

## Code
I would be really pleased about some suggested improvements for my code or other stuff like documentation.

## Execute the code
To see results you just need to execute RunMatch.py **-** soon you will be able to change the agents very easy and fast  (at the moment you have to change the functions name in run_match)
### First
```
python RunMatch.py
```

### Second
```
match = Match(("MCTS", "ALPHABETA"), start_board)
```
